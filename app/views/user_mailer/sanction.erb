 <h1>Welcome to DressRental. </h1>
    <p>
    You didnâ€™t forget that your thing must be returned on time and be in the same form in which it was when it fell into your hands? :(
    </p>
    <h3> We really hope so!</h3>
    <p>
      If these requirements are not met, your seller <%= @user.product.salon.seller_info.user.name%> <%= @user.product.salon.seller_info.user.surname%> has every right not to return your security deposit. We do not need unnecessary problems, just like you. 
    </p>
    <p> Let's continue to be friends </p>
    <p>With love DressRental!</p>
